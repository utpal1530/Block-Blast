# TODO for Making Block Blast Responsive and Touch-Friendly

- [ ] Update styles.css to use responsive units for #game, #board, .block, and .blast elements.
- [ ] Add media queries for smaller screen sizes to adjust layout and sizes.
- [ ] Modify script.js to add touch event handlers (touchstart, touchmove, touchend) for blasts.
- [ ] Disable default drag and drop on touch devices.
- [ ] Implement touch drag and drop logic to allow smooth dragging and dropping of blasts on the board.
- [ ] Test on phone or emulator for smooth touch drag and responsive layout.
